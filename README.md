# ML_Advanced_Learning_Algorithms
Coursera - Machine Learning Specialization ( Course 2 )

Week 1
++++++
1. Neurons_and_Layers.ipynb
      Explore the inner workings of neurons/units and layers.
      Introduce Tensorflow and demonstrate how these models are implemented in that framework.
2. CoffeeRoasting_NN_with_TF.ipynb
      Build a small neural network using Tensorflow.
3. CoffeeRoasting_Numpy.ipynb
      Build a small neural network using Numpy. It will be the same "coffee roasting" network implemented in Tensorflow.

Week 2
++++++
1. ReLU_activation.ipynb
      Test how the ReLU's non-linear behavior provides the needed ability to turn functions off until they are needed. 
2. Derivatives_for_Backprop.ipynb
      Intuitive understanding of derivatives.
      Explore a simple way of calculating derivatives arithmetically.
      Introduction to a handy Python library that allows us to calculate derivatives symbolically.
