# ML_Advanced_Learning_Algorithms
Coursera - Machine Learning Specialization ( Course 2 )

1. Neurons_and_Layers.ipynb
      Explore the inner workings of neurons/units and layers.
      Introduce Tensorflow and demonstrate how these models are implemented in that framework.
2. CoffeeRoasting_NN_with_TF.ipynb
      Build a small neural network using Tensorflow.
3. CoffeeRoasting_Numpy.ipynb
      Build a small neural network using Numpy. It will be the same "coffee roasting" network implemented in Tensorflow.
